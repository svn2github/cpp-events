This directory contains suit of research projects (probes) that are used during
development for gathering information about slick language and compiler details.

Each project is implemented as a single source file in the 'src' subdirectory.
They are compiled and executed via CMake's 'try_run()' command. Some of these
tests are run-time tests - they collect information during their execution and
should always compile without errors. And other are compile-times tests - they
check if this or that language trick will be accepted by the compiler.

All tests are executed when running CMake. Generated project files are no-op.
